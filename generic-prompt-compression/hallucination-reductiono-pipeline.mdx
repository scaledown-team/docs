## Work done by Yang Zhou

The pipeline's modular design can be integrated into ScaleDown as a new, premium API endpoint, `/pipeline/run`. This service would orchestrate complex LLM workflows while leveraging ScaleDown's core token compression at each step.

Hereâ€™s how the four key components can be integrated:

### 2.1. Composable Stages as a Service
The pipeline's core strength is its sequence of composable stages. This can be directly exposed to the user.

* **Integration:** The `/pipeline/run` endpoint would accept a JSON payload where the user defines the sequence of stages they want to run.
* **API Payload Example:**
    ```json
    {
      "question": "Who received the IEEE Frank Rosenblatt Award in 2010?",
      "models": {
        "target": "gemini-2.5-pro",
        "helper": "gemini-2.5-flash"
      },
      "pipeline": {
        "stages": [
          {"type": "baseline"},
          {"type": "apo"},
          {"type": "cove"}
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

### 2.2. "Gates" for Intelligent Cost Control
The pipeline uses "Gates" for early exits, saving cost and latency if a high-quality answer is found early.

* **Integration:** The gate policy can be a configurable parameter in the API call.
* **API Payload Example:**
    ```json
    {
      "question": "...",
      "pipeline": {
        "stages": [...],
        "gate": {
          "mode": "judge",
          "judge_model": "gemini-2.5-flash",
          "threshold": 0.9 
        }
      }
    }
    ```

### 2.3. Prompt Rewriting as a Pipeline Stage
The Automatic Prompt Optimization (`apo`) stage rewrites prompts for clarity.

* **Integration:** Offered as a specific stage (`"type": "apo"`). Users could call a pipeline with *only* the `apo` stage for advanced prompt engineering.

### 2.4. Verification and Self-Correction Stages
The Chain-of-Verification (`cove`) and `self_correct` stages fact-check and improve answers.

* **Integration:** Offered as optional, high-value stages. A user can add `"type": "cove"` to their pipeline to explicitly request that the model verifies its answer.
